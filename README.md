## Team Number 23 - VoteBank


### Project Overview

In the New Normal (Digital) approach towards everything, there also comes a need to assess every individual's choice and opinion.
Previously this was carried out using traditional voting and discussion sessions, while the discussion has scaled up to virtual meetings
there still seems space for considering public voting systems. Online voting systems could be the key and if the security and the anonymity of the voter are kept intact, online voting can be the best choice.

In this project named "VoteBank", we tried to devise a user-friendly yet secure method to carry out a public voting process.
Assuming (as per the problem statement) we have access to the email IDs of the voters, we can easily map out the valid voters and
also, make sure one can make at most a single vote(as quoted by the Indian Constitution "One Man, One Vote").

### Solution Description

- In this project we made a web app which has several routes (ex. /admin, /voter), only the admin is given the '/admin' route in which he adds the details of the poll, the nominees, total number of voters(safety purposes) and the list of voters(excel file) and the time the voting starts.
- A link is provided to the admin which can be mailed to the voters and the systems start at the time set by the admin.
- Once the voter chooses his candidate and submits the form the server processes the request:
  - checks if the voter is on the voters' list( given by the admin ).
  
  - checks if the user has already voted (by checking against the database for a parameter
  'isVoted' which sets to 'yes' once the user has voted and cannot be tampered with again, also the voter count helps to cross-check if a faulty vote has come to       notice)
  - if no errors or problems occur, the 'isVoted' parameter is set 'yes'.
- Once the link is on for 45mins(can be extended), the result of the poll is reflected on the admin page.
